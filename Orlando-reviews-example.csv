Market On South,2/3/2017,"My 100th review goes to one of my favorite vegan restaurants in town! I love this place and can't believe I hadnt posted a review. This restaurant has saved my life on most meatless Mondays, have always felt full and satisfied with most of what Ive ordered.

First off the staff is very friendly and helpful, everytime I can't decide what to get they practically make the decision for me and the food is always great!
Ive had their pulled BBQ jackfruit sandwich, tiki tacos, mac n cheese, potatoe salad, and of course can't miss out on the best donuts in town!!! I usually stob try and order something different while Im there so I prob didn't mention every meal Ive had but my favorites are def their tacos and donuts, so must try those!

Overall if you want to experience the best vegan option in town that has a pleasant atmosphere, great food, and the best donuts this place is it! I would even consider going vegan if I could afford their food everyday (let me not get carried away, I still like meat!...but you get my point).",5,4,1,4,Juanita C.,84fJiqGWmwZFWA9CsJSP0g,
Market On South,1/31/2017,"What a wonderful find. Market on South is a three business consisting of Dixie Dharma, Valhalla Bakery and Humble Bumble Kombucha.I've had the pleasure of trying both Dixie Dharma and Valhalla Bakery on separate occasions but not Humble Bumble Kombucha yet. I've heard great things though. This place has a very bohemian vibe. The outside looks like a house and the inside is very cozy and small.

Dixie Dharma is plant based food. They use all plants to make sothern style food. It's really cool because they have sloppy joes, pulled pork Sandwhiches and other southern cuisines but it's plant based and absolutely mouth watering. I'd say it's great for vegans specifically but it's honestly great for anyone to try.

Valhalla bakery is a 100% vegan bakery. They focus on just about any dessert you can think of but it's vegan.  They are most popularly known for their donuts which taste and look amazing. Also they're kind bigger than your face. They also make cakes, cookies, cupcakes, brownies and more. They can specialize anything... like the most amazing unicorn cakes and more upon ordering.

I 100% suggest trying Market on South! I wrote a personalized review for Dharma Dixie and Valhalla Bakery if your interested in lerarning about my experience with each check them both out!",4,1,,,Ashley B.,yROH68ur31AmT04scG24mg,
Market On South,1/29/2017,"Ok so I can DEFINITELY tell that this isn't real meat, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food is good for what it is.

The Orange Bird - An orange bbq sloppy joe and sloppy it was. Couldn't taste much of the roasted garlic sauce, but the sandwich as a whole was quite delicious. The bbq was sticky and sweet, nicely counterbalanced by the slaw. It's pretty hearty so it's a good pick if you're especially hungry.

Crispy Brussels - A little too burnt for my taste and still retained the natural bitterness. I had trouble finishing it, but pushed through since I paid the extra $1 for this premium side.

They also have some baked goods which quickly disappear, and once they're gone, they're gone. Many customers came solely for the donuts so I have little doubt that they're good.

Overall, this is how you do vegan. A bit pricey, but I'd be willing to come back to try their other dishes and their desserts.",4,3,2,2,Tracey K.,FFmaRF_y7hA9Kt94yv1K5Q,f8d50af8-3446-3791-aa68-dbd75d19f44c.jpg

The curry peanuts are such a unique side and were delicious! Finished my meal off with some doughnuts which were made so well. Nice and soft and not too sweet!

Market On South,1/26/2017,"I tried this place when it first opened and wasn't all that impressed...

But, now I gave it another try and I LOVE it! I checked it out with a friend who can't eat any kind of food with unnatural additives and usually eats vegan out of convenience. She could eat everything here and was super happy with Valhalla Bakery! It was breakfast time so she opted for all sweets - a cookie brownie which was to die for and the Death by Peanut Butter which was super rich but heavenly!

I opted to try the more savory side of things and ordered their Jackfruit Bbq Sandwich and Brussel sprouts. The sandwich was good, but wasn't super memorable to me (maybe it might be more so for vegans that don't eat regular bbq, but for me, it felt like it was missing something). But, the Brussel sprouts STOLE THE SHOW! They were phenomenal and I would go back just to have them again. They kind of tasted like Kobe's Hibachi as strange as that sounds? Maybe it's just that they're a little charred and the sauce has a similar teriyaki taste, but I'm not crazy because my friend totally agreed with me.

I will definitely be trying out other sandwiches and sweets here! I'm eyeing the donuts big time!

I definitely recommend trying this place out - or trying it again, if like me you thought it wasn't amazing when it first opened!",4,4,2,3,Allie R.,fuSnEjjZMdZ5TNBjhO7v2g,

Market On South,2/25/2017,Ok... I ordered the soft taco and it was good. I don't know what value the jackfruit added since it didn't really taste like anything but I thought (perhaps bulk) I'd try it since I've never had jackfruit. The kale salad was surprisingly delicious (there's an aromatic taste but I just can't put my finger on this ingredient). I had the death by chocolate cupcake because the bar was pretty large and O M G... moistest vegan chocolate cupcake ever! The top was covered in a vegan buttercream with chocolate chip cookie and I know I tasted PB in there somewhere. My husband had the donut and I thought I saw his eyes roll back for a second. I am afraid to try it because then I'll be hooked and will start eating and ordering donuts from this place!

Market On South,1/11/2017,"I had bookmarked this place when I was in town last week. I couldn't stop drooling while I was bookmarking hot spots.
I went with my mom and we didn't have enough time to sit down, so we ordered to go. The location is right off of the highway so it's very convenient. There is enough parking, but I wouldn't recommend a big group as there might not be enough seating.

It's a chill spot that you can drink, catch up with your friends and enjoy delicious and healthy food.
I ordered the T.L.T.- their take on BLT with tempeh. It was AMAZING. The pressed bread and texture of the tempeh, arugula, and tomatoes was definitely a delicious mouth party. (Keep your minds out of the gutter, ya'll. You wish you were invited to the TLT party.)
The TLT was a combo so I chose the crispy brussels sprouts. They were as crispy as they were marketed to be and also delicious. They weren't bitter and left a pleasant aftertaste.
We also ordered the nopales taco and Tiki tako. The tiki tako had BBQ jackfruit. Never had that before and was in love. The nopales taco tasted like a fajita. I was more a fan of the tiki.

They are moderately priced, but well worth it since it's a vegetarian/vegan establishment.
ALSO, dessert is no joke to them. I got the hibiscus berry donut and y'all....heart eyes. Someone propose to me with all those desserts and I will say yes.

I honestly dream about them like a schoolgirl dreams about her crush. First time I came here I have the Jackfruit sandwich, it was really good honestly tastes like meat. my friend ordered their home fries with cheese and I would advise against ordering that it wasn't good.

Market On South,12/16/2016,"I am digging Valhalla Bakery.  Before I say anything else--don't try a little dessert before your meal comes. I meant to just taste but scarfed that Nanaimo bar down (mint) before my sandwich came. It was delicious and unlike the yoyo cookies at publix (don't judge), didn't make me feel at all unhealthy.

I love love love the market on South Street. I had to go to a little trouble to find it - - it's not any place I normally travel, but I will travel there again and again and again. The Florida fried green tomato sandwich was excellent, really unbelievably good with a number of surprising details. This thing is made from scratch and it's made with love--no kidding.  It was the best sandwich I've had anywhere in awhile but blew both infusion and dandelion cafe out of the water for taste.

The brussels sprouts were perhaps the best I've ever had. (I know--I'm raving about sprouts.  Believe me I'm as surprised as you are.)

My vegan friend took me here on a Sunday around 4pm and I was blown away by everything but especially the food.

The atmosphere is laid back and hipstery. There are art prints, jewelry, candles, terrariums and more for purchase scattered inside made by local artists. They have a cute little garden growing in the front of the restaurant and picnic benches to sit on as well.

When you enter you'll be immediately greeted by a display case of the most delectable and appetizing desserts you've seen. (PLUS they DON'T have to be kept refrigerated if you want to take some to go since they don't use eggs or milk )

We order the Fried Green Tomato and the Orange Bird with sides of Baked Mac n Cheese and Cheesy Homies. I'm salivating just thinking of this meal. If you didn't tell me the Orange Bird wasn't chicken, I never would have guessed. The texture was spot on the the flavours were delicious. The fried green tomato slices were thick and tasty and the bread was toasted to absolute perfection in all its (vegan) buttery goodness. I would order this again!

My mom and I went yesterday for lunch. The inside is small and quaint. You order at the counter and then pick a spot. Don't over look their brunch menu! I almost didn't see it because it was in a frame on the bar.

I got the Carolina BBQ jackfruit sandwich with a side of mac'n'cheese. My mom initially ordered the Orangebird but then we saw the brunch menu. The staff was very accommodating, switched my mom's order and didn't charge us the difference to upgrade! How often do you find that these days?!

I enjoyed my sandwich. I wasn't sure what to expect but I definitely felt better after eating it than I do BBQ pork. It had a slightly sour taste which I assumed was the Carolina twist. The mac was good too.

Then I got dessert. Vegan dessert. I couldn't choose one so I figured go big or go home. I got three bars: the Heath peanut butter Oreo, the smores, and the apple strudel. All of them are over the moon good. Butter? Who needs it! Eggs? Overrated! Milk? Step aside! You wouldn't ever know that those things were missing.

Updated review","Vegan food never tasted so good!

The BBQ pulled jackfruit sandwich was amazing. The jackfruit ""meat"" could fool even the most dedicated carnivore. It was a meat party in my mouth and everyone was invited!

The donuts were incredible. Deliciously moist, it didn't taste like your standard vegan sweets. This place is special. There's a reason there is always a literal line out the door.

If you're new to vegan food, don't fret! The staff is willing to patiently answer all of your questions and welcome you with open arms to our freakish compassionate cult.

I mean come on, with Market on South there's no reason NOT to be eating vegan.

My favorite veg spot in Orlando, by far!

Only downside is the price. For a sandwich shop/bakery the prices are pretty high. Three of us come out to over 45 dollars. Favorite place to eat but can only come once in a while.",4,3,3,2,Christopher W.,B6eFobMzYncks28Q-9-G8g,8205bf10-82ea-3633-92f3-4be5f035ee57.jpg

Location is easy to spot off of South St and is relatively easy to pull in to. Ample parking on either side of the building.

When you walk in you are immediately overtaken by the smell of baked goods. Inside there is a decent amount of seating but I can see this place filling up fast around lunchtime. I'd recommend being there around 11:30 am for lunchtime to beat the rush.

The entire time you're looking at the menu, you're haunted by the baked goods in the glass to your right. The clerks are in a relatively nice mood and are very accommodating. The food is all vegan but don't be strayed by that, order anything and you'll forget there's no meat.

The sandwhich was so gooooood! I shared with my sister; she got the California Pulled BBQ Jackfruit sandwich and cheese homes. The cheese homes was probably my favorite thing and the sandwich was amazing!

 The prices for the food is on the higher side for what it is but that is probably because of it's great ingredients and it is worth it! The bake goods are pricey and I haven't tried them but I would like to try something.

Market On South,3/28/2016,"I've been here on 2 separate occasions and I would totally come back again. Since I don't eat most animal proteins, this is a great place to dine at where I don't have to ask a zillion questions about ingredients since everything is vegan/vegetarian.

Desserts by Valhalla Bakery are rock solid as in GOOD. I have yet to enjoy the coveted doughnuts that sell out quickly. But I have had the Yolo (buttercream icing between 2 fresh baked cookies) and the smore. Both were out of this world deliciously sweet. On my most recent visit, I had lunch with a friend who does eat meat. Dixie Dharma is in charge of the savory lunch items. My friend had the Orangebird which is their plant based version of a Sloppy Joe.  She commented on how hearty it was for not being actual meat. I had the fried green tomato sandwich which is prepared on toasted sandwich bread and dressed with kale and chow chow. We both had a side of brussel sprouts which were amazing and so tender. But next time I'm itching to try their version of baked mac 'n cheese!  They also have a limited beer/wine menu here. I did have their iced coffee but nothing special.

The market is smaller than I expected. I was expecting something along the lines of East End Market's layout. Instead, you walk in and there is one counter where you order from meaning one line that can get very backed up. There is seating inside and a few tables outside for your convenience or you can get your food to go. They also have displays throughout the market of locally made products for purchase so it's nice to browse after you've had a meal here.

I love the laid back environment and how open folks are to trying a plant based menu. I hope the popularity continues and more businesses like this open up.

Market On South,3/9/2016,"I need to preface this by saying I am a carnivore and vegan food scares the crap out of me. I don't know why, but if you slap the Vegan label on something, it immediately freaks me out!

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner, which had I known where we're going ahead of time, I would've made other suggestions. However, I'm glad it was a surprise and I am so glad we are here.

He had the TLT (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) with brussel sprouts and it was amazing. The sandwich was delicious and the sprouts were cooked perfectly.

I had the sloppy joe, which was made from ""vegetable protein,"" and it was amazing. I have no idea what the heck I ate, but it was meaty, the sauce was perfect, and it was so big I had to use a fork to eat it. I had the Mac n cheese as my side and had I remembered that vegans don't eat cheese and I was eating fake stuff, I wouldn't have gotten it. Again, my preconceived notions were blown away as the Mac n cheese was incredible! Cheesy and garlicky and very yummy.

I like that they serve locally crafted beer from around the state and my bf was THRILLED that they served Mexican Coke. His eyes lit up like the 4th of July when he found this out - apparently it's a lot different than US Coke.

Overall it was a great meal and a pleasant surprise. We can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu!

The down side is the menu is fairly pricey and I'm already sick of the choices. For this reason I limit my visits to about once a month.  Hopefully they'll get some new ideas soon. I can't wait to check out their trivia nights.

It was still a cute place with a nice atmosphere. It's not really a market persae more a quick style restaurant and donuts with small things for sale like hot sauce and chips. I tried the donut with fruity pebbles and it was just as I had hoped and I got the last one :) for lunch I got the sandwich with the fried green tomato with a side of Brussels sprouts and my friend got a salad. The fried green tomatoes are delicious and plump! Probably the biggest and juiciest I have ever had. Some places really give you a small sliver but not here. The seasoning was a little heavy on the sandwich so I had to take off a piece off bread but other then that I really enjoyed it. You can miss this place easily so keep an eye out.

My friends and I dined here for dinner and were greeted as soon as we walked in. Based on some of the pictures and reviews that I had read here on Yelp, I already knew what I wanted, the Pulled Carolina BBQ  Jackfruit sandwich with a side of brussel sprouts.

First the sandwich. Wow was it tasty! If you were to have blindfolded me and told me it was pulled pork before hand, u would have believed it. Everything about it was right. The jackfruit was sweet and complimented the tanginess of the sauce, saltiness from the pickles, spiciness of the arugula, and crunchiness of the fried onions. It was perfect.
The brussel sprouts were off the chain! I loved that they were crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. I was tempted to order another side, but was too full. I dream about them though lol.

Speaking of full, if you have any doubts about a vegan meal being filling, trust me when me when u tell you, you will leave satisfied.

On the way out, I ordered the chocolate chip cookie Yolo to bring to my mom. She called me the next day to tell me how good it was and asked me when u was going back to get her more.

Try some of the Sweet Utopian almond hazelnut milk. They come in different flavors (strawberry is my favorite to date) and they are sooo good. (Also they are vegan, soy free, and gluten free).

From Valhalla, I bought two of the YOLOs. One was strawberry cream and one was vanilla maple I believe. They are giant cookies sandwiched together with cream - which totally lives up to their name YOLO.

I love this place and plan on returning 9 million more times.",5,1,1,1,Nicole D.,UE1lKXD4whGAwQUTN9jw4A,79d2471f-f845-3c00-bedd-8f4d7a0a9221.jpg
Market On South,7/4/2016,"I got here after the dinner menu closed, so they were only serving limited options. Of those options, they didn't have many GF choices. There are so many people with gluten sensitivity - many of whom are vegan that this place should have better options. They have kombucha on tap with some bottles options. I orders the tater salad it was good I had hopes of more.

Menu aside, the service was ok. I asked if there were GF options and I got a response like - I think the dogs have gluten and all the baked goods have gluten because they taste better that way. Now imagine if the word gluten was replaced with eggs or butter or milk - yeah exactly point. He was a jerk.

Market On South,12/31/2015,"I never thought there could be such a thing as amazing vegan barbecue, but thanks to Market On South, there is!

My family and I have been here several times now and the food has always been great!  We've tried the Georgia Peach sloppy joe, Carolina BBQ pulled jackfruit, mac n cheese, crispy Brussels sprouts, potato salad, and a variety of baked goods.  We liked all of it, but our absolute favorites were the Georgia Peach sloppy joe and crispy Brussels sprouts.  Veggie hotdogs are available upon request for children, which my child was totally stoked about, so bring your little ones along as well!

Now it's been a LONG time since I've had real pork barbecue, but the Georgia Peach sloppy joe tastes so similar to what I remember real BBQ tasting like!  The first time I tried it, I had to question for a moment if somehow I read it wrong and I was eating meat-ha!  Luckily, it really is vegan and absolutely AMAZING.  Pair this sandwich with the crispy Brussels sprouts and your tastebuds will be in absolute heaven.  

I finally got to try the donuts today and they were heavenly!  Definitely the best vegan donuts in the state of Florida (and I've tried quite a few).

The space is pretty cool.  You walk in, order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.  There's both indoor and outdoor seating and a retail area with some cute little items as well.  You bus your own table towards the back of the restaurant on the left hand side.  Our first time here we were clueless and put our dirty dishes in the wrong spot (sorry about that!).

Market On South,6/8/2016,"I came to Market on South yesterday really excited. I love it when I can eat food that I can feel good about eating--I'm by no means a vegetarian, but when I go out and can get some tasty veg food, I'm all about it.

I ordered the orangebird, which is their classic sloppy joe with a Florida orange BBQ twist. While I the bun was fresh and fluffy and perfect and the homemade slaw was fresh, I couldn't bring myself to like the filling. The sauce smelled so good, but when I ate it the tanginess of the sauce mixed with the faux meat in a funky way that left a really pungent taste in my mouth for the rest of the night. I ate a lot of it, trying to acclimate myself to the tastes in hopes that it would get better....and it didn't. I was really disappointed.

I got a side of the mac and cheese that people raved about, and I wasn't feeling that, either. I love garlic--when recipes call for garlic, I'll triple or quadruple the amount, my love for it is so strong. But this ""mac and garlic"" was too much for me, and I ended up only eating a few bites of it before I gave up.

Okay, so maybe the savory didn't do it for me. The beautiful thing about Market on South is all that they have to offer! I got a butterfinger pie and a naniamo bar. For $7 a pop and bearing the name of one of my favorite candy bars, I had high expectations of the butterfinger pie. But when I bit into it, it was flavorless. The texture made me think of eating flavorless, sugar free whipped cream. At this point, I was really, completely disappointed.

My faith, completely depleted at this point, was rekindled by the naniamo bar. Oh wow, THAT is what I had been waiting for! Chocolate ganache layered over a creamy filling, with a coconut crust?? The perfect combination that somehow stayed on the right side of not-too-sweet.

I really wanted to love Market On South--the decor was so cool and laid back, the mission so feel-good, and the people so kind. With how many misses I had in the food department though, I can't hop on the bandwagon so many others have found themselves on.",2,5,2,4,Biz S.,H7SkPGqm4ZAoR5ZrjP3bVA,

Market On South,6/8/2016,"So I'll start by saying that I'm most decidedly not a vegan. But my issues with Market on South are about the space itself, not the food. (Well, I guess I do have issues with the donuts too, but you can read about that in my review of Valhalla.)

By calling themselves a market, I expected a larger space with more clearly defined dining/retail areas. Not just everything shoved into a tiny space. I guess I can't fault them for the unexpected popularity of the donuts, even though I don't understand it. But once you've got all these people taking up room inside the building, it might be time to rethink the layout. I was able to browse some of the products while waiting in line, but I would never go to Market on South just to shop, even though there seems to be some neat stuff available. It's just too hard to squeeze around people and tables to get to the actual stuff being sold. And if I wanted to buy something, it's not clear how I would do so.

Also they need more than one trash can in the building. No one was really bussing/cleaning tables so we had to wipe down our own table. Not a big deal, except that it took forever for us to finally spot the one trash can (hidden behind the donut line) to throw away the dirty napkins.

I get that running a small business is hard and kudos to everyone involved with Market on South for trying. There's definitely a lot of potential in what they're doing. At the moment though, it's not really for me.",3,2,,,Lisa N.,cMUo-e1If4hP_GivbjQntQ,

Market On South,11/11/2015,"Orlando friends, the heavens have graced us with a delicious plant-based restaurant and everyone owes themselves the joy of tasting it. I am a vegetarian but I know this place is fit for carnivores as well! The presentation and taste is so good you would never know the difference.

I went with a friend of mine and we ordered two sandwiches and split them. The first item I tried was the Georgia Peach Sloppy Joe with a side of collard greens. The flavors of the sloppy joe was perfect and mixed well. The collard greens were cooked to perfection! The next item was (my personal favorite) the Carolina BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were delicious but let's talk more about the sandwich. By far the most clever thing I've ever tasted! Who would have known jackfruit could have done me so right. Kudos to the creators or Market for dreaming up a plant-based version of a pulled pork sandwich.

Another cool feature to note is all of the local take home goods for sale like gluten-free sauces, honey, and pasta among other things.

I haven't had a chance to try the bakery treats, but trust me that is next on the list!",5,4,2,2,Georginia H.,3Judre_y0be7MIvT5ZIIxg,5b6698a3-2f01-35fe-ac5f-a78767e699e4.jpg
Market On South,10/21/2015,"You guys, ""Orlando's first vegan commissary kitchen"" is here and I dig it!

This is a 100% plant-based spot and, please note that this review is coming from a carnivore and yes, you are reading correct: 5 stars.

Three vendors came together to create The Market on South- Dixie Dharma, Valhalla Bakery, and Humble Bumble Kombucha. I love when fabulous vendors collaborate and make something event more fabulous... #doublefabulous

So there is a walk up order counter for food and some items you can buy to take home or goodies to help you in the kitchen at home. There are sammies and soup and dessert. What more could you ask for? Delicious beverages? Oh, they have that too!

I went for the Ginseng American Classic Root Beer after I was intrigued from seeing a pic on Yelp and it blew my mind. I could have easily drank 17 of these with the smooth taste and touch of earthy sweetness.

The side of the day was brussels sprouts and they were cooked to perfection; crispy, tender and tasty just like I like them.

I chose the Georgie peach sloppy joe and I could have sworn it was legit BBQ/Meat. It was lived up to it's name and was very messy but the flavor stood out with a mix of savory and  balanced with sweet peaches. Yum.

Strawberry YOLO Cookie is a must! It's messy but worth it. It's a sugar cookie sammie with delicious strawberry cream. Light, fluffy and delectable.

Some seating inside and out so you can dine on this deliciousness on any gorgeous Orlando day. They are also starting cocktail after 9 o'clock along with bar snacks.

Market On South,4/15/2016,"One of the best bakery restaurants in Orlando!

Oh. My. God. I'm writing this review a few minutes after finishing my food. While I'm full, I wish I could eat my food all over again. Market on South is THAT good. I had heard about Market on South from Yelp, both online and at a Yelp event. Since I lived a mile or so from the restaurant, I figured I should give it a try before moving up to Winter Park. I'm so glad that I did.

Market on South is located on South (one-way street) heading towards Mills. It is in a very nice outdoorsy type of area, which includes parking in a dirt lot, a rental bicycle stand, and a nice outside seating area. Once I went inside, I saw a wide range of small ""hipster"" stands, ranging from a spice area to other random merchandise. I then walked up to the counter and encountered the delicious-looking (and soon I found find out tasting) bakery counter. The bakery counter, food counter, and beer area are all connected together, so I took some time to look at all three. Another girl came in right after me and decided to do the same thing. The cashier didn't seem surprised by this (because I'm guessing many people do this), so she asked if this was my first time. When I told her it was, she explained the concept behind Market on South and gave me some suggestions and answered questions.

Before I get to the food that I ate based off her suggestions, I want to comment on the friendliness of the staff. They noticed that I was taking several pictures and asked if i was a Yelper. When I told them I was, all the staff started talking about Yelp. Everybody there likes it and understands the Elite Yelper concept, and they all also read the reviews and try to use them to make things better (one girl pointed herself out as ""tattooed hipster"" from Rita S.'s review below. I couldn't tell if she thought it was funny or not, but when I told her that meant she was memorable, she seemed pretty happy). One of the managers, Samantha, came up and chatted with everyone about Yelp and how she wished she could be Elite, but couldn't because managers can't be as involved on Yelp to prevent conflicts of interest (something I very much appreciate). It was very refreshing to see that restaurants not only care about reviews, but are interested in engaging with Yelpers and using those reviews to improve the experience for everyone.

Well, I can tell you that one area that doesn't need to improve at all is the food! I ordered the Orangebird with mac & cheese, as well as a chocolate pb&j. Once again, oh. my. god. The chocolate pb&j tasted like a large Reese's as a baked good with some type of fruit thing in the center. It might be the best restaurant-made dessert ever made. The Orangebird, which comes with some barbecued chicken and coleslaw, is very tasty and filling. As for the Mac & Cheese? Well, all I have to tell you is that I usually put salt on all mac & cheese, but Market on South's version was so good that I didn't need any salt at all!

Overall, Market on South is a fantastic bakery restaurant that provides amazing food and a unique and friendly experience. Anyone who ever steps foot in Orlando needs to try this place (at least) once.",5,20,8,16,Brent B.,yBpajT9TpzIpLtINu3Xl0w,"373dd1af-ad1a-3c9b-b100-919c14b8e4ab.jpg,64bca05a-cd57-3e7c-95c5-316eeb4c3285.jpg,3eb2cd49-7a9e-3aa9-ac76-9b1d97f7f349.jpg,f7ddb5b4-197c-3ca8-a4b5-fe01a6b4713e.jpg,726b3c09-3f0a-3755-8582-6f6183e1aad7.jpg,3ca13ac7-022f-3cf4-bb71-8a2594cd5c42.jpg,d841c1c9-1085-3344-8653-3e25aa6ae489.jpg,930dbed3-7933-3b5b-b99a-6655d7202127.jpg,cfb27b05-b93a-3bb3-8777-b03d7a7c64d9.jpg,2cc92603-a32e-35e5-bd90-8acedf4b7d6b.jpg,abca2719-40b3-3d8a-b02e-cec578111110.jpg,3f52116c-8767-3fdb-8a24-99a05da20980.jpg,41ee166a-a126-30eb-87c6-2fe9a4e5acd1.jpg,ae694686-3b3d-3704-8e2e-a1732d6ea0bc.jpg,b22be186-c762-3cd0-b470-b03b0ec8f3e5.jpg"

Mom had the Carolina pulled BBQ jackfruit,  my sister and I had the hail kale salad with tempeh and fried green tomatoes,  and my other sister (who must have meat,  not vegan or adventurous) had a side of mac and cheese.  My salad was ok,  a little light on the dressing but my sisters mac and cheese was delicious.  My mom's sandwich as well was beautiful and tasted great.

Market On South,10/14/2015,"5 stars for a new eatery/market that combines some great vegan businesses and that looks like it'll keep growing!

Oh what a fabulous new lunch spot! I ordered the jack fruit BBQ sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were coated in honey and some other magical goodness for what ended up being greens you could serve to any child and get a smile! Seriously, I'm loving the current obsession with Brussels sprouts and this spot does it right!

The jack fruit BBQ sandwich was a thing of beauty. If I can eat like this sans meat, then this vegetarian thing may be worth another look! The sandwich was smoky and sweet, with a touch of sour from what appeared to be candied lemon rind sprinkled within. I am still daydreaming about that dish!

And one can't pass up the dessert case, filled with fabulous looking tarts and treats from Valhalla Bakery. If you have a chance to try the strawberry vanilla YOLO cookies sandwich, be a doll and order me one too! Was it messy? Yes. Did I care? Nope!

It looks like Market in South has room for a local pantry of Orlando made products. They already had a display with sauces and pasta, and I saw a fridge with cold pressed juice and some produce.

It's smaller than East End Market, but their focus on vegetarian/vegan is smart, and the quality of the food partners makes this a new entry in my list of local faves!",5,21,13,18,Andi P.,hdzTAN8DGJKRddkZ8279JQ,"33600ab3-c793-3c6f-b36d-79f21277bb97.jpg,2f59df6c-76c9-36bf-916e-f0488d8b797a.jpg,826f1c9c-7a88-3efd-bc46-112afb68fc28.jpg"

The staff are very friendly and it only took two visits to be on a first name basis with the staff, I love building connections like this with places that I love. Regular guests should be remembered and the MoS staff do an excellent job of upholding this idea. The pulled Jackfruit sandwich is amazing enough to replace any Pork lovers Pulled Pork sandwich.

Market On South,4/5/2016,"I have been waiting, almost dying for this moment, and it's finally has come. I've made it to Market on South.

I've been hearing about this heaven for what seems like 78 years now and all of my friends keep insisting that I had to go here because it was amazing. It wasn't that I didn't believe them, it was the fact that I never go the chance to. Well that has changed and I'm SO happy to that.

Market on South seriously is amazing. They offer all vegan food and pastries that are too incredible for words. Now, listen to me when I say this, I've eaten vegan food for a very long time now but I have to say that Market's is INCREDIBLE.

Let's talk food now, cause boy, oh boy. So, we order 6 dougnuts, 1 cinnamon bun, one TLT sandwhich and one BBQ Pulled Jackfruit sandwhich. These doughnuts were everything I wanted and more. These doughnuts were moist, sweet, soft, melt in your mouth, gooey, greatness and I couldn't be happier. They are exactly what I want from doughnuts.

The food was, again, outstanding! My TLT came with a side of mac and cheeze and after I was done with it I wanted an entire bowl of it to take home. (Can you even do that, though? Cause if you can I'm so doing it!) The TLT was juicy, fresh, flavorful and simply finger licking awesomeness!

The BBQ Pulled Jackfruit sandwhich came with a side of brussle sprouts (which I don't like at all). This sandwhich can fool even the meatiest of meat eaters because it's that damn good. The flavor is there, the consistency and texture were definitely there as well.

Overall, I just can't say anything but good things about Market! I will be coming back over and over and over again.",5,25,7,19,Jose A.

Market On South,"10/27/2016
Updated review","I've been here a couple of times and I'm always so impressed by the food. It's a little too heavy compared to what I usually enjoy, but it's all really excellent. I love how it feels like a BBQ restaurant sans the actual BBQ. So far I've had the fried green tomato sandwich and the Carolina BBQ jackfruit sandwich with either mac and cheese or brussels sprouts. I enjoyed the green tomato sandwich with the brussels sprouts the most. The mac and cheese isn't bad, but has a slight aftertaste that I'm not fond of and the jackfruit is super good as well. I just loved the green tomato sandwich more. There's local kumbucha too, which isn't sweet but that's why I prefer it.
I also love their vegan donuts! Whoa, they're so good and you're lucky if you can snatch some on a weekend before they sell out.",5,1,,,Victoria B.,q7NHAghJX3WxaXmjPeXVvA,
Market On South,1/2/2017,"Oh my goodness, easily some of the best vegan food I've ever had in my life! This location is a shared space that houses a restaurant and a bakery. My friend and I came for a casual lunch on Sunday and everything was absolutely fantastic. I tried the Orangebird sandwich and wow just wow! It's an orange BBQ seitan (if I'm not mistaken) sandwich topped with slaw and a garlic spread. The only thing that would have improved it would be some spice or cayenne in the BBQ sauce but not everyone can do spicy so it's completely understandable. For my side I chose boiled peanuts and unfortunately they were too salty for my liking. My friend got a jackfruit sandwich and collards and was very happy with her meal. I also took 2 doughnuts home to share with friends and the Oreo mocha was a fan favorite! The churro doughnut received mixed reviews. I thought it was tasty but very bread heavy and friends who tasted it mentioned they found it a bit dry. Overall my experience was extremely positive and I look forward to returning!

Market On South,11/15/2015,"The food here is a dream. No complaints at all. Words can't describe the wonderful marriage of barbecue and vegan food that Dixie Dharma has been able to achieve with their fare. I had the BBQ pulled jackfruit sandwich with a side of braised collards. This was the best thing I have eaten in a while. The jackfruit was surprisingly meaty. It was tender and reminded me of pulled chicken.

It was sandwiched between two crispy pieces of toast, adorned with a pickle and a few other things, and topped with lemon zest. The lemon zest is what made this sandwich heavenly for me. The lemon zest added a delightful zing to the sandwich, a whole new level of boldness, and overall a great contrast to the rich, BBQ jackfruit. To take something that is traditionally so heavy and to transform it into something so refreshing, is a true art.

I also tried to Peach Sloppy Joe with crispy Brussels sprouts. This again, was a winner. The peach BBQ sauce was the perfect addition to the crumbles of tempeh. This was also extremely meaty and was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The peach BBQ sauce was incredibly unique and had a subtle spice to it. The deep fried brussel sprouts were lightly seasoned and it all paired so well together.

I also had a Nanaimo bar which was named after the English town the owner was from. The best part about this was the coconut, chocolate cookie crust. It was salty and sweet perfection. I did not really like the custard the bar was filled with since it just tasted like 1.5 inches of buttercream, but it was still good. I can't believe it was all made from vegan ingredients. I regret not trying more of the desserts, but that just means that I need to visit again.

The Market on South is a great idea. It is similar to East End Market in a sense that they are providing a myriad of local businesses all under one roof. The market itself was filled with cool local finds such as soaps, ketchup, and art. The decor was prairie chic and really warm and inviting. The wide open space really made the Market bright and comfortable. The dark woods added a subtle contrast to the whole space.

In front of the Market, they grew their own veggies which is something I love to see. They really do a great job at shining a light on the local flavors of Orlando. I love supporting local businesses, so having a whole bunch of them under one roof was a delight.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Market on South. The service was great. The food was SPECTACULAR. The message behind the place is inspiring.

We ended with a cupcake and a mocha yolo (cookie and frosting sandwich) and it was so good.

I knew that I was probably not going to get to try the donuts since I went for lunch but I was still looking forward to trying the food. I tried the orangebird with a side of mc & cheese. I must say I think the prices are a bit high for the size of the meal. I paid $13 for this small meal and it was nothing out of the ordinary.
The mc&cheese had a strange sensation of both too sweet and too sour at the same time. I didn't know if it was just bad or if that's how vegan mc&cheese tastes. It left a horrible after taste in my mouth and tasted nothing like cheese. The sandwich also had a very weird taste to it so I don't know if I would order it again.
I then wanted a dessert but they ranged from about $7-$9 which I didn't want to pay for a dessert.

Market On South,10/26/2015,"The wife and I, along with our newborn son and corgi, decided to check out this local new market close to our house (we live in Lake Como). A fun family outing! So, we walked down there one evening last week when the weather was amazing.

The worse part of this was crossing Anderson/South streets.

This place is adorable. I absolutely love it! AND, I love its potential!

We got there as the sun was setting. And, while there isn't a lot of seating on the front patio, we were lucky enough to be welcomed by another couple to sit with them. THIS is one of the main reasons I love places like this! For the community as much as the food and drinks!

We setup shop at a table outside and I went in with beer on my mind. I wasn't disappointed. NOTE: Everything on tap is local (read: Florida). I hope this stays that way. They don't have a ton of taps. But, this is not a tap house. So, if you are looking for that, look elsewhere (and there are plenty of fantastic options in the City Beautiful!).

I ordered the Tomoka Brewer's Breakfast Brown Ale. It was outstanding!

My wife went in to order...I told her to get me something as a surprise. Now, I forgot to mention I was in the mood for something sweet but also tart or fruity...like one of the amazing lemon desserts I saw in the case. But, she brought out a Nanaimo bar. I had never heard of these (I've since looked them up..from Canada!). Now, I'm not a chocoholic like some. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This thing was incredible. Just the right amount of chocolate for me! and, while I'm not vegan (my wife is), i was super impressed by how amazing it tasted. Maybe I'll only ever get vegan desserts from now on!?!?!

My wife got herself a salted pretzel.. This thing rivals non-vegan pretzels...and, I honestly think it was better than any ""regular"" pretzel I've had.

Once it was dark, a staff member came outside and kicked on the lovely string of lights above our head. It was shortly thereafter that our newborn decided to freak out and we had to do the awkward walk home nearly one mile with a screaming baby. Hey, we are new parents...live and learn I suppose.

Bottom line: I can't wait to go back. Especially as we enter Florida's ""winter"" with amazing weather. It may be dangerous on my gut. But, I go to the gym, right? Plus, I'm a dad now. I have to work on my dadbod!",5,1,,,Mark P.,7qzCJ-d7QMrZ5u5tASg8uQ,"f27748fd-f70e-3b6d-9b2d-3b05494cf935.jpg,680f60e7-5908-3712-b426-d1589fef0578.jpg"

Market On South,2/16/2016,"Let me first start off that I am not vegan nor a vegetarian but a hardcore meat eater. However, I do enjoy vegetables with every meal to include my breakfast so eating at a vegan place was not all that crazy for me. After reading some Yelp reviews and looking at all the yummy pics beforehand, my husband and I tried the sloppy joe with a side of mac and cheese and the pulled pork sammie with a side of Brussels. The desserts looked fantastic so we got the bourbon chocolate chip cookie and their signature dessert which I forgot what it was called but it was a dessert bar with dark chocolate on top, cream in the middle and a coconut graham cracker crust on the bottom. We couldn't wait to eat them so they became our appetizers. Holy moly they were so rich and divine, we could only take a few bites before we were too full!! Had to leave room for all the yummies coming.

The sloppy joe was out of this world and I could not believe I was eating jackfruit!! My mom grows these in her backyard and I am going to tell her she needs to figure out how to make this!! The texture of it was so much like the real thing! Crazy! But the flavor of the sandwich was so sweet and savory. The toasted bun was also perfect. The mac n cheese was also delish, though just a tad too salty but I didn't care as I ate it up!

My husband's bbq sammie was also the bomb and his Brussels were cooked perfectly. His portion was smaller than mine, but that was ok, he was still full in the end. We actually had a lot of leftovers so took it all home with the desserts too and happily ate it all again for dinner.

Before we left, we ended up also buying a jar of fra diavolo sauce from The Cookery which is sold in the market and I can't wait to go home to try it with shrimp and pasta. We have had salsa from The Cookery and it was amazing so I can imagine the pasta sauce will be too!

Definitely would go back here again and recommend to even the pickiest of meat eaters! You will not be disappointed!",5,1,,1,Georgina G.,iaF63wthFr3333daJXFwEQ,
Market On South,12/22/2015,"Market on South is the brainchild of three different vendors who were looking for a place to showcase their products. Dixie Dharma provides the southern inspired vegan comfort food, Valhalla Bakery fills the dessert case with vegan sweet treats and Humble Bumble Kombucha brews up the refreshing kombucha combinations that are found on tap.

The menu is limited, only twelve items from top to bottom, but that doesn't make it any easier to decide what to get. Do you go with a Pulled Carolina Jackfruit BBQ Sandwich? Maybe a Georgia Peach Sloppy Joe or a Tempeh Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich? I decided to go with my ol' Southern standby, the Fried Green Tomato Sandwich. The Market on South version is topped with garlic kale, chow chow and smoked eggplant remmy. As a side I ordered crispy brussels. J-Fur got the Hail Kale Salad with Smoked Tempeh Bacon. For Z-Bot, we wanted Market on South's Mac and Cheese but they were all sold out. They suggested cheesy potatoes as an alternative so we gave it a go. To wash it all down, Citra Hopped Humble Bumble Kombucha.

Market on South's Fried Green Tomato Sandwich includes two extremely thick sliced tomatoes served on bread that is also sliced thick. It reminded me a lot of Texas Toast because of how wide it ran. The top of the bread is sprinkled with paprika. While I didn't really taste anything different with the paprika dusting, it made the sandwich look really cool. As far as the taste goes, whoa baby. The tomatoes were nice and crispy and the breading held up nicely to it each bite (nothing worse than losing all the breading after just one bite). The garlicky kale and pickled veggies were a nice touch adding a punchy, slightly sour note to the tangy tomatoes.

Don't be scared away by the extra dollar price tag for the Crispy Brussels. These little bad boys are totally worth it. They are fried and seasoned to perfection and by that I mean that I've never had brussels sprouts that tasted this good before. These definitely aren't your mama's brussels.

I don't suggest you eat the cheesy potatoes expecting them to taste like their non-vegan counterparts, you will be disappointed. That's because they are much more flavorful. While most regular cheesy potatoes do their taste making solely from the dairy, these spuds didn't have the option to fall back on that pattern. Instead the combination of spices and marinades employed by Market On South created a nutty, umami packed flavor bomb. I'd love to say that my daughter enjoyed these potatoes but she was so set on Mac and Cheese that she didn't even touch them. Oh well, that meant more umami for me.

The kale salad had both its good and uh, not bad per se, more like just adequate. First, the good. The homemade croutons were extremely flavorful as were the greens. I loved, loved, loved the pickled red onion and watermelon rind which contrasted the greens nicely. The greens themselves were really well done with just a hint of garlic to them. The adequate? That would be the smoked tempeh bacon. I expected something salty and contrasty, that's what I remember about bacon. This version was way too sweet for my liking. I never was a hickory smoked fan.

I grabbed some sweets to go. While the whole case looked amazing I decided on, after recommendations from the cashier, a Lavender and Vanilla Bean Yolo and a fruit bar. The fruit bar was soft and moist, not overly dry like a lot of vegan fruit bars I've had. I thought the fruit taste was much more muted than I would've liked. I like my fruit bars to taste super fruity.

The star of the dessert show was definitely the Lavender and Vanilla Bean Yolo. A Yolo is basically two cookies surrounding a cream center. There was definitely a lot that could've gone wrong with this dessert. The filling and cookie could've been too sweet, too dry or too oily (just to name a few). But both of them were oh so right. I could've sworn that the filling in the middle had dairy in it because it didn't seem weirdly textured or flavored in the least. There was a hint of vanilla bean that existed throughout the dessert but it was the lavender that was king. This Yolo had a strong enough to notice, yet subtle enough to not be overkill, lavender taste. If you aren't a fan of lavender, don't think this dessert will mask it. It's all there for the tasting. If you are a fan of lavender, might I suggest you find your way to the Milk District of Orlando and hit up Market on South pronto.

I was very much impressed with my accidental visit to Market on South in Orlando. Its memorable food and completely vegan menu has me counting down the days until I return.

Upon my arrival, I was kindly greeted by the staff and asked if I had any questions. I've been here before however, and already knew what I wanted. Tacos. Not just any kind of tacos, though. Some sort of special taco that could challenge my taste buds. I promptly asked the lady at the cashier if I could have two tacos, one BBQ pulled jack fruit and one tempeh. I was feeling particularly good about myself that day so I also ordered myself a mimosa. The lady thanked me and I took a seat outside with my mimosa in hand.

After a brief waiting period, my tacos came. They were beautiful! The complexity of the flavors and textures were incredibly tasty and I ate them all. I ordered the Brussel sprouts which were a sad excuse for a 'healthy' option. They tasted almost like thin, crispy French fries and I loved it.

All in all, I loved this place. The people here are super kind and have a passion for what they do. You don't just see it in their faces, but you also see it in their food.

It was all truly delicious! Although I do wish I would've gotten more of a crunch from the breading on the tomato. What I would've done is instead of two thick slices of the tomatoes I would have 4 thinner slices and all heavily breaded for that nice salty delicious crunch.

Market On South,12/21/2015,"This place is legit. If nobody had told me that Market On South was a vegan restaurant, I never would have known the difference.

Tucked away on South Street, just outside of downtown, is the wonderful new Market On South. I'm extremely late to the game on checking this place out. My friends have been raving about it for weeks. So, I finally got a chance to give MoS a try.

The inside is welcoming and chill. All of the staff members I interacted with were super nice and felt like they really wanted everybody to have a great experience. I had their take on a sloppy joe, They call it the Georgia Peach Sloppy Joe, so I'm guessing they use some form of peaches as the ""meat"". I wouldn't just say that this was one of the best vegan plates that I've had; I'd say it's one of the best sloppy joes I've ever had, vegan or not. The flavor was delicious! And again, if I didn't know otherwise, I would have assumed I was eating ground beef. I'm going to assume that the chefs went to Hogwarts and learned some mystical wizardry that allows them to make vegan food that can easily pass as non-vegan. Definitely Ravenclaws.

My side was a tater salad, and it was great. I like that they throw some seasoning on top of the potato salad instead of just mixing potatoes with mayo and calling it a day like most restaurants do.

Up front, they have a dessert case. I was full after dinner, but the next time I'm looking for a little something extra after dinner, I'm totally coming here to try their desserts. They look amazing.",5,2,1,1,Peter G.,rJYoQTkV6wgzF8Hb9wobpA,

First off, it's getting easier to find vegan food in Orlando, which is awesome. But along with that, it means we have a lot more to compare so the (soy) cream rises to the top, so to speak. Market on South is the soy cream of the crop (I'll stop with the metaphors, I'm sorry... I'm not sorry.)

Let's start with the very few drawbacks- there is no sidewalk really so if you walk there, you're basically walking alongside South St traffic which can get a little worrisome. Also, they don't have coffee- yet. They will be rolling that out, but for now you have to survive off the natural caffeine in the chocolate. Mmmm, chocolate.

Now the good stuff! This place proves great things come in small packages, and even with how seemingly small the Market is, the layout makes excellent use of the space so you don't feel cramped or crowded. I haven't tried the food food yet (because you skip dinner and go straight to dessert when Celine's making the dessert- that's just a rule.), but I'm very excited to and I'll add to this review when I do. However, I had some of the bakes goods from Valhalla Bakery and OHMYGODGUYS, it's SO good. Thanks to so many places making vegan desserts, it's easier to tell when something is quality and baked with finesse or when the bakers is just lazy and throwing sugar at the problem (COUGHrhapsodicCOUGH). Celine went above and beyond and gave me a sample of the new soft pretzels she was trying out. Now I know you THINK you've had a soft pretzel before, but trust me- this will change your life. In fact, my new ideal evening is going there after work for a beer and pretzel and pretending that calories aren't a thing. (I'm just cultivating mass, bro)

I could go on forever about the food but let's chat about the actual building. It's cute, in a great location, I hear talks of a Saturday market in the back parking lot, AND talk about kid friendly- they have a nice pinterest-worthy changing table in the bathroom. I can't tell you how much that came in handy when my little guy decided to stare me in the eyes and express his annoyance with me through feces. That being said, this isn't Gymboree, you'll see some cute little ones running around, but there is a healthy mix of all sorts of people who appreciate good vegan food/dessert/beer/wine/(future)coffee/kumbacha made correctly all in one awesome and beautiful laid-back environment.

Come for the soft pretzels, stay for the tattooed hotties milling about.",5,13,3,7,Tairi P.,seV-WtQg3oiOHkymKxan3Q,"91f34039-71a8-3476-adff-710f7cfcd5a9.jpg,477f2f03-a45e-33ad-ab29-f4d9db4caa96.jpg,258b2d79-6a7a-3507-a427-1e8363b02235.jpg,6b728737-61ae-3baa-9e68-c38651ae3115.jpg,986a36bb-4d94-3109-995c-55c438a29941.jpg"

Market On South,5/14/2016,"I love this place so much. They definitely show all the vegan-haters what vegan food can really be.

The donuts from Valhalla bakery are always a crowd pleaser. Buy a dozen for your next brunch get-together, but make sure to get there early! They are usually sold out of donuts by noon, and there's a line around the building before Sunday opening. The pistachio Rose is my favorite so far.

Dixie Dharma is amazing southern comfort food. My go-to is the Carolina now pulled jackfruit sandwich with crispy onions, and the tater salad for the side. Make sure to try out all the sides!

They also have some great gifts and great craft beers on hand. This is a great stop for vegans and omnivores alike! One of the few vegan places my boyfriend actually enjoys.",5,2,,,Taylor D.,dSxxszmgOBLaZ9pxoQ_1Yg,

I also picked up some revolution sauce ketchup the first time I was in and I put it on just about everything. Make sure you grab some baked goods to go.

Market On South,4/21/2016,"Let me just start this off by saying I am an absolute carnivore and there is no denying it.

We joined a group of friends who were going to Market on South for lunch and had no idea what to expect, but all they told us was the the food was incredible and it's all the rave right now. When we arrived at Market on South that's when my friends decided to tell me that this place was vegan. Not a fan of trying new things, I decided to stick with it anyways and venture out of my comfort zone.

The place looks exactly like it does in pictures. When we got there the line was out the door, which made me think, wow this place really must be good. The first thing I saw when we stepped inside was the massive cinnamon buns being made right in front of you. It didn't take long to reach the front of the line to order, which was nice, especially being that I was starving. I ordered the California Pulled BBQ Jackfruit sandwich with a side of mac and cheese, and a massive cinnamon bun on the side for dessert (there were no more doughnuts :( ). After we all ordered, we realized there wasn't really anywhere to sit. We finally got a table outside and once we got settled, the food had come out pretty quickly.

Just from the looks of it, the food looked really great. I first tried the mac and cheese, and that first bite tasted amazing, though, the more I ate it, the more I realized it had a funny taste and wasn't what I was used to. When I tried the sandwich, I knew that it was going to be hard to finish. I don't know what everyone else is talking about, but the texture and taste is not the same as meat. Because I was starving and I paid like 16 bucks, I obviously finished my food, but I found myself wishing I was somewhere else. When I took a bite of the cinnamon bun, it made up for everything. It was literally heaven.

If you like vegan food, or are into trying new things, then I say go for it and give Market on South a shot! If you aren't into vegan food and don't like trying new things, I still say go for it and get the cinnamon bun!!!

Market On South,4/17/2016,"I was very excited to check this place out, but was left pretty disappointed.  The prices are pretty high ($16 for sandwich and iced tea), but I was ok with spending that much with the hopes of a great experience.  My fried green tomato sandwich was just bad.  The bread was smothered with I think paprika, which for finger food is a terrible idea.  I couldn't pick up the sandwich without my fingers turning bright orange.  Just be prepared for overly ""foofoo"" food.  If I ever go again, I would just go for dessert, that food smelled amazing!!

The ambiance is also just alright.  It's on South Street, which isn't exactly the nicest of streets.  They have a garden alongside the road, and I just thought about the amount of car exhaust hitting them the whole time.  I hope they don't use any of the veggies from that garden.  I did enjoy looking at the local goods being sold in the store from local vendors.",3,5,2,,Jessica R.,quyzbUzxUwXZpZd4t57xVA,

Market On South,4/9/2016,"I went here on a Sunday, for the Valhalla Bakery.  Place was packed, but service was fast. One of the staff members saw me taking pictures of the place, while online, and she made some comments toward me that seemed like she was making fun of my pictures... I thought that was weird, but was so excited about the donuts I really didn't care.  Donuts were tasty, but a bit too large, I would say. Normally, i wouldn't see this as a bad thing, but they are very fluffy and since the toppings are only on one side, the rest of the donut seems without flavor. I solved this ""problem"" by cutting a layer from it, therefor making my donut not as tall, but still fluffy and very delicious.  The coffee was a bit disappointing.  Maybe it's a stereotype, but with good pastries, I expect good coffee. Coffee was a regular brewed cup of joe. Overall, I'm not a huge donut fan, but these donuts did the trick... and even better, they are Vegan! I'm not a vegan, but I can appreciate good vegan/vegetarian food. Employees were friendly, even though the place was packed and service was fast.

Market On South,5/22/2016,"I really loved my visit to Market on South.  It's a fast casual scratch made vegan comfort food offering.  5 stars for location and just vibe.  One thing I hate in restaurants is finding a table.  It stresses me out.  I deducted 1 star because I believe there is room for improvement to ste up a system.  What you do is order your food, then find a table.  Of course, my husband and I did that and oh my there were people just sitting at tables while their friends and families were waiting in line.  I could have sat down, ate and the table would be there for them.  Nope.they just wanted to sit there for 20 minutes taking up valuable space.  And this was not on one occasion, but two.  I noticed that happened a lot.  Okay...well that's the critical part done.

The good.....The food is awesome, spot on.  Creative, tasty and filling.  I like the fried green tomato sandwich, it was perfectly balanced.  I think the chef goes a little crazy sprinkling paprika on everything because my husband and I left with red fingers.  just a little feedback there I didn't deduct a star for that.

I have frequented Market On South multiple times and tried many of their menu items. Market On South is the perfect place for sweet and savory dishes. The savory from Dixie Dharma, serving southern vegan dishes, and the sweet from Valhalla Bakery, serving incredible cakes, donuts, pies and much more.

Entering the market, you walk up to the counter, gaze above at the yummy menu over the bar and order with the employee at the register. After that, you go find a seat and they bring it right to you!

I have tried the fried green tomato sandwich, pulled jackfruit BBQ sandwich,
Tiki tacos with both tempeh and jackfruit, and last but certainly not least, sides of crispy brussels, cheesy homies, creamed corn, and Mac n cheese.

The fried green tomato sandwich is such s classic for me and has become one of my favorite menu items. The green tomatoes are so thick and it's always a bit of a challenge finishing the entire sandwich.

The crispy brussels are flash fried with an amazing hint of sweetness. I actually crave them.

Sometimes Dixie Dharma has a ""side of the day"" so keep an eye out for rotating side items.

On to the sweets!

Valhalla Bakery never ceases to amaze me with incredible desserts time and time again. Whether it be key lime cupcakes, creamy Nanaimo bars, or perfectly fried donuts, you can't go wrong here.

Updated review","Ok I'm starving, my husband is starving. It's 930pm, we call, the kitchen is closed and we can only get hot dogs and baked goods and beer, of course, says Ronnie. We've heard about this market three times in the last week, everyone says it's so amazing. So, we are going to do vegan hot dogs.

Mark says, ""How good can a vegan hot dog be?"" You see, we're not vegan. In fact, I'm barely vegetarian. Mark, he's a lacto-pescatarian if we're gonna get technical. Me, I'm a come what may kind of eater. I mostly choose healthy, mostly will eat what he eats, but I'll still throw down a steak if given the opportunity.

My first thought, ""that's not a very big hot dog."" Remember, we're Stahhrving. I had my heart set on the Sloppy Joe, but we were too late for that. We ordered the holiday hot dog, cran-something with crunchy onions, idk. I'm in, I took Ronnie's recommendation, I just want it to taste good.

Jesus, Mary and Joseph, it's epic. It smells like a hot dog, it's tastes like a hot dog. It's gourmet hot Fricking dog. It's gone, I washed it down with a Funky Buddha draft. It was perfect and without the guilt of eating Miss Piggy. Best of all, size didn't matter. I was completely satisfied.",5,,,,Sammy S.,Tl_CnlYkrXC_HfcVrFpTAg,6279d193-9e1c-33b5-947a-cddfc8e991c0.jpg

Market On South,4/13/2016,"This little cafe brought a TON of flavor. Most (if not all) of the menu items are vegan but every option sounds so amazing that I don't think you could go wrong. Just choose anything on the menu and your food will quickly be brought out to you by a tattooed hipster (of course) and then your taste buds will sky rocket to the vegan heavens.
I came there the day before a half marathon, so I needed to fill myself with some carbs. I chose the pulled jackfruit sandwich and all I can say is YUM. I had never tried jackfruit before, but it had a thick, meaty texture to it, yet did not leave me feeling heavy like meats do. It was made with a barbecue-like sauce and had some arugula in it, with lemon zest and balsamic topping off the sandwich. I took off the top piece of bread and ate it as an open face because the faux meatiness of the jackfruit quickly filled me up. Each bite was a perfect mix of zest, smokiness of barbecue, sweetness of jackfruit, and overall deliciousness.
I got the braised collard greens as a side, which were slightly spicy but not too spicy and their juiciness complemented my sandwich well.
I tried a small bite of my friend's sloppy joe, and whatever was in it also tasted delicious and had the texture of meat, but not the heavy flavor.
They also have a ton of vegan baked goods - my one regret is not buying a vegan cookie for later!
Their prices are pretty hefty though, 12$ for a sandwhich and some sides, like brussel sprouts are even $1 more. I would have bought a baked good but didn't feel like spending ~$5 or a nanaimo bar (but I shall be back).
Overall, the perfect fusion of smoky, flavorful barbecue fare, but in a light, guilt free, and unique vegan presentation.",5,1,,,Rita S.,aa9xI_BuZqp6AFB-RypglA,2202e3c8-4123-3dbe-9aee-ddb0995cb541.jpg

Market On South,3/29/2016,"Ever since my husband had a triple heart bypass last August, we have eaten much, much less animal products. Consequently, we have been searching the city for great vegetarian/vegan options.

We really enjoy this place! For you meat-eaters out there, you will come out thinking ""I couldn't believe that didn't have any meat in it at all. Seriously"".

I got their version of a sloppy joe which has peaches in it; it was incredible! It is so full of flavor, I could hardly believe it. Incredibly hearty, enough that a big guy with a large appetite would love it. Messy enough that I just ate it with a fork; but messy is good!

Hubby got their version of a BLT but called the TLT; the first T standing for tempeh bacon. He thought it was excellent and hearty as well.

We also loved the laid back atmosphere. It was one of ""Yeah, we make great food here that just happens to have no animals products in it"". It welcomes people who are trying out a plant based lifestyle or people who just want to try something different; it doesn't matter to them. No preaching, just good food.

We also tried a few of the bakery items and loved them as well.

Try them, especially if you've got someone in your life that you're trying to introduce plant based eating.

We will definitely go there again. I hope they make it because Orlando needs more non-chain, healthy restaurants!",5,1,,1,Bonnie R.,R0V89h80dxhHOSb5kIj-FA,
Market On South,6/17/2016,"Not a vegan, by any stretch of the imagination. I love meat. Standing over a grill with a big ole ribeye or a chicken is home. The jacked fruit ""pulled pork"" with Carolina BBQ sauce fooled me. The braised collards as a side and a grapefruit and Ginger kombucha made for one hell of a meal.",5,,,,Will B.,#NAME?,2e30ae2e-189b-35b0-a66e-db8cfffdb257.jpg
Market On South,2/15/2016,"The food is decent,  but the customer service needs improvement. I was visiting the area and very excited to try their donuts, but they were sold out.

I asked to place an order for the following day, but was informed that they no longer took special orders. Furthermore,  that I would have to come first thing in the morning and wait in line. One person behind the counter explained that it wasn't fair to have 50 preordered donuts unavailable to customers waiting in line. I explained that I was visiting from out of town, but they would not budge.

I don't understand the logic. If I have the foresight to plan ahead, why should I have to wait in line and then maybe or maybe not come away with donuts?

When I called the following afternoon as I was on my way, I was told that the donuts were sold out. Arghh! The guy on the phone said I could try back the following morning at 8 am. NO THANKS!

With the Drunken Monkey close by, and Ethos not too far away, I will take my vegan business elsewhere.",2,3,,1,Susana S.,tu0uBq0qJxAlKmiJs92QIw,

Market On South,10/9/2016,"I had the FGT sandwich and it was absolutely relish! I had studied menu before I got there, so I was set on the FGT sandwich, but also saw that had a brush menu. Th menu looked good and with interesting options. I also had a great beer on draft. I am not sure of the name but it was a wheat beer. Overall, I great place and will go back.",5,,,,Yvette P.,T8aDp2TBbz6uBepTP8l76Q,
Market On South,5/3/2016,"Good location and great staff. I visited on two occasions once to get doughnuts and another for Kombucha. The first attempt I tried to get doughnuts at 6pm and when I asked where are the doughnuts I was informed I needed to come in very early to get them. Apparently the doughnuts are the shizzy and sell out immediately. I ended up getting a cold pressed juice from the juice bar :) It was amazing.  
The second visit I got the Kombucha. It was okay. I have never made my own and do not consider myself a Kombucha connoisseur but in my opinion the house brand was bland.  It mainly tasted like water with a very light hint of flavor.  I was not a fan because I like a punch of effervescence at the back of my throat and smelling the strong aromas as I taste it. This variation was lacking in my opinion.

BUT they have good beer, a great atmosphere, and tons of things you can purchase from local vendors. I love this place because I discovered the juice bar here. And I will always stop in and check for doughnuts.",4,,,,Naomi W.,5Opu1lytpcmVhla59ZKmcQ,

Market On South,3/6/2016,"Vegan. Donuts. Amazing. It's everything you probably didn't realize it could be.  And everything you'd want it to be.

Let's talk details(aka the deats, the tails).  This is my third time there.  First Sunday and it was busy.  Everyone has the donut munchies on Sunday apparently.  I got the pistachio orange blossom donut.  It was delicious, if not a tad sweet for my taste.  I wouldn't have minded even a bit more pistachio flavor and even nuts in the donuts. Love pistachios.

My friends got the sprankles donut and a cinnamon roll.  The cinnamon roll was yuuuugggeeee.  And very tasty. Like it was basically the size of a small child.

Quick side note: 4 stars not 5 was only because they didn't have any thin mint donuts left :'( and of course that was my fault for not coming earlier.
Go check out Market on South.  Quench your donut thirst.  You'll thank me.",4,1,1,,Matthew I.,QNQCIwIujO8A6e3sCUBZOQ,
Market On South,6/2/2016,"This place is a dream. The food is delicious and everyone who works here is friendly and helpful. I've been here many times and even brought a group of non-vegan coworkers here for a birthday lunch - they were licking their plates by the end of it.

And, of course, no meal is complete without a delicious dessert. The YOLO cookies are addictive. If you haven't been yet don't wait any longer. This place is amazing. I

If you're going for lunch, get their early so you can grab a table. Enjoy :)",5,,,,Natalie A.,ixhzK0zZeKCEcruhFRomng,

Market On South,1/26/2016,"I come here so often they know my name.  Vegan food doesn't get much better than this. My favorite items are the Kale Salad and the Fried Green Tomato sandwich.  The brussel sprouts are definitely my favorite side.

Beyond the healthy vegan food options are the awesome baked goods by Valhalla Bakery. Her donuts are a big hit in the community, but I personally love her cinnamon rolls.  She is always making new items so it's fun to see what new things you can treat yourself too.",5,3,,2,Lindsey T.,kXv5zCJJva13TNCsjKB_Hg,
