Market On South

"Ok so I can DEFINITELY tell that this isn't real meat, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food is good for what it is.
The Orange Bird - An orange bbq sloppy joe and sloppy it was. Couldn't taste much of the roasted garlic sauce, but the sandwich as a whole was quite delicious. The bbq was sticky and sweet, nicely counterbalanced by the slaw. It's pretty hearty so it's a good pick if you're especially hungry.
Crispy Brussels - A little too burnt for my taste and still retained the natural bitterness. I had trouble finishing it, but pushed through since I paid the extra $1 for this premium side.
They also have some baked goods which quickly disappear, and once they're gone, they're gone. Many customers came solely for the donuts so I have little doubt that they're good.
Overall, this is how you do vegan. A bit pricey, but I'd be willing to come back to try their other dishes and their desserts."
